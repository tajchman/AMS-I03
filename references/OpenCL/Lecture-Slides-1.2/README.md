Introduction
============

(PowerPoint slides don't behave well in git and so this repository only contains
the specific versions that we release. You can find these under 
["Releases"](https://github.com/HandsOnOpenCL/Lecture-Slides/releases)).

This set of freely available OpenCL lecture material, together with the
[HandsOnOpenCL exercises and solutions](https://github.com/HandsOnOpenCL/Exercises-Solutions)
have been created by Simon McIntosh-Smith and Tom Deakin from the
University of Bristol in the UK, with financial support from the
Khronos Initiative for Training and Education ([KITE](http://kite.khronos.org/en/opencl))
to promote the use of open standards. 

[Simon McIntosh-Smith](http://www.cs.bris.ac.uk/home/simonm/) is
one of the foremost OpenCL trainers in the world, having taught
the subject since 2009. He has run many OpenCL training courses
at conferences such as SuperComputing and HiPEAC, and has provided
OpenCL training for the UK's national supercomputing service and
for the Barcelona Supercomputing Center. With OpenCL training
experience ranging from half day on-site introductions within
companies, to two-day intensive hands-on workshops for undergraduates,
Simon can provide customized OpenCL training to meet your needs.
